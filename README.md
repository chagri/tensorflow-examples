# tensorflow-examples

A set of examples using tensorflow for machine learning classification

## Regression

### Left Footprint Length and Height in Indian Adult Male Tamils

Dataset originally taken from [here](http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~winner/datasets.html). Full dataset available [here](http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~winner/data/india_foot_height.dat).

To run, `cd` into `india_foot_height` and run `python india_foot_height.py`. It'll print out the value of the cost function on each iteration of training and in the end plot the fit function on the dataset.

## Classification

### Iris Flower

Description of the dataset available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris), and the actual dataset is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data).

To run, `cd` into `iris-flower` and run `python iris-flower.py`. It'll split the total dataset into training and test sets, train a neural network and then plot the value cost function over time.
